**Flower Species Classification using ML Algorithms**

**Project Objective**

This project classifies the 'Iris' flower into three different species using Machine Learning (ML) models. The classification is based on four key features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

We implement and compare different ML algorithms to analyze their performance in distinguishing the three species of iris-versicolor, iris-virginica and iris-setosa with the said measurement values.

**Models Used**

**We explore the following classification algorithms:**

1) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A simple instance-based learning method.

2) Support Vector Classification (SVC) – A variant of SVM that finds the optimal decision boundary.

3) Naïve Bayes (NB) – A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

4) Logistic Regression – A linear model for binary and multiclass classification.
